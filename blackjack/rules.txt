Welcome to blackjack!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rules are simple:

The goal of the game is to get the total of your cards as close to 21 as possible.

If you go over 21, you go bust and you lose!

Cards 2-10 are their values, J, Q and K are worth 10 each.

However, the Ace is special:
	Its' base value is 11,
		BUT:
	If you go over 21, its' value is changed to 1!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different things you can do each round, depending on what cards you draw:

	Twist:
		When you want another card, you twist!

	Stick:
		When you want to stop playing and keep your cards, you stick!

	Split:
		If both of your cards are the same value, you can split! This means you can
		have 2 goes at getting 21. You can twist on each card individually, and if
		you go bust on the first one, dont worry! You have another chance!

	Burn:
		If your cards add up to 13, you can burn! This gets rid of your cards and
		replaces them with 2 brand new cards!
